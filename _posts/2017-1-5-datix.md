		<h4>Improve patient safety and create a culture of learning</h4>
		<p>
			Our organization has adopted Datix, a web-based risk management software to provide an integrated healthcare experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			To ensure Datix was well-accepted by caregivers - Quality and Patient Safety team, Risk Management and I worked together to create a video on how to:
		</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Capture and review data</li>
			<li>Navigate the Event Status Dashboard</li>
			<li>Monitor event progress</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Chapter Markers</h4>
		<p>A navigable chapter list help viewers navigate within the video and make it easy for them to quickly jump to the section they want.</p>

		<h4>Activity report</h4>
		<p>
			eLearning videos has become the most popular medium through its easy to digest format; but how can you track the performance of your content?
		</p>
		<p>
			To measure the level of engagement, I used the following xAPI statements to find out which parts of the video were played, skipped or paused during viewing sessions.
		</p>

			<div class="pictures statement">

		<h4>Demo</h4>
		<p>
			You can interact with the video below to see what your statements would look like.

		<!-- <h4>Learner Retention</h4>
		<p>
			By monitoring the learner activity, I can use it to get an idea of how how well the video keeps its audience,average view duration, and where in the video people are dropping off.
