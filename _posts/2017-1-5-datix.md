# A Culture of Patient Safety through reporting

The Risk Management team and I created a video on how to capture and assess important details in Datix, a web-based risk management software, to make incident reporting the easiest thing to do on our caregiver's list.


# Video Analytics

Video has become one of the most engaging form of content. They can make information more digestible and easier to understand than a text article.

But for most organizations, simply having video content available isn't enough.

You need to know if people are actually watching your videos. 

<!-- Using xAPI, I was able to track interest and engagement to get a comprehensive view of the ROI of our video investment. -->

## Chapters

Added chapter points to make it easy for viewers to quickly jump to the section they want without having to search for it.

## Viewer Retention

Using xAPI, I was able to capture actions like when the video was played, paused, completed, seeked, skipped, and where in the video people are dropping off.

## Demo
