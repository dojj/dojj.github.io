# Improve patient safety and create a culture of learning  
The goal was to make incident reporting the easiest thing to do on our caregiver's list. To make sure Datix was well-adopted, the Risk Management team and I worked together to create a video on how to:

* Capture and review data
* Navigate the Event Status Dashboard
* Monitor event progress

But creating a video is just the start of a continuous process. You need to measure the performance of your videos to learn how you can improve the next one.

The amount of views is a helpful metric, but how do you know if people actually watched it?

<!-- xAPI and xapiyoutubewrapper allows you to capture user actions like when the video was played, paused, completed, abandoned or skipped, and convert these metrics into an actionable data. -->

## Video Analytics


## View Duration 

The average view duration tells us the amount of time the average learner spends watching the video.

This provides a rough benchmark to evaluate and compare it to similar contents.


## Percent Completion

This metric is the % of a video that is watched by a learner.

For example, if a user watches 20 seconds of a 30-second video, the video view rate percentage is calculated as 66.66.
This metric provides a sense of how well your content aligns with the learnersâ€™ needs.


## Retention

The purpose of this metric is to monitor video performance in retaining learners, and visualize drop-off points.
