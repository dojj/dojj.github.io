# A Culture of Patient Safety through reporting
The Risk Management team and I created a video on how to capture and assess important details in Datix, a web-based risk management software, to make incident reporting the easiest thing to do on our caregiver's list.  
<br>
I created an eLearning video to show our caregivers how to:
* Access Datix.
* Use the Event Status Dashboard.
* Document the Management Review.
* Attach documents and use templates.
* Understand the Leader Sign-Off process. 


# Video Analytics
Video has become one of the most engaging form of content. They can make information more digestible and easier to understand than a text article.  
<br>
But for most organizations, simply having video content available isn't enough. 
You need to know if people are actually watching your videos.   


## Chapters
Chapter points were provided to make it easy for viewers to quickly jump to the section they want without having to search for it. This was also a good way to see the most seeked part of the video.

## Viewer Retention
Using xAPI, I was able to capture actions like when the video was played, paused, completed, seeked, skipped, and where in the video people are dropping off.
