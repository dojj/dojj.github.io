		<h4>Improve patient safety and create a culture of learning</h4>
<!-- 		<p>
			Our organization has adopted Datix, a web-based risk management software to provide an integrated healthcare experience.
		</p> -->		
<!-- 		<p>
			To ensure Datix was well-accepted by caregivers - Quality and Patient Safety team, Risk Management and I worked together to create a video on how to:
		</p> -->
			We wanted to make incident management the easiest thing to do on caregiver's list. To help caregivers capture and assess important details in Datix, I created a video on how to: 
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Capture and review data</li>
			<li>Navigate the Event Status Dashboard</li>
			<li>Monitor event progress</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Chapters</h4>
<!-- 		<p>
			A chapter list help viewers navigate, make it easy for them to quickly jump to the section they want without having to aimlessly scroll through the video.
		</p> -->
		Included chapters to make it easy for viewers to find relevant content without having to search for it.

		<p>I embedded each chapter with Triggers to track the most popular topic.</p>
		<h4>Learner Retention</h4>
		<p>
			The amount of views is a helpful metric, but that doesn't say too much about the performance of the video. 
		</p>
		<p>
			By capturing actions like when the video was played, paused, completed, abandoned or skipped makes it easy to turn these metrics into an actionable data.

		<!-- <h4>Learner Retention</h4>
		<p>
			By monitoring the learner activity, I can use it to get an idea of how how well the video keeps its audience,average view duration, and where in the video people are dropping off.
