# Creating a Culture of Patient Safety through Reporting

<div class="img-container">

</div>  
<br>
The Risk Management team and I created a video tutorial on how to capture and assess important details in Datix, a web-based risk management software, to make incident reporting the easiest thing to do on our caregiver's list.  

<br>

Our goal was to show our caregivers how to:

* Access Datix.
* Use the Event Status Dashboard.
* Document the Management Review.
* Attach documents and use templates.
* Understand the Leader Sign-Off process. 

## Using Video in eLearning

Video has become the most engaging form of content. They can make information more digestible and easier to understand than a text article.

According to <a class="source" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/complete-white-paper-c11-481360.html">Cisco</a>, video traffic will make up 82% of all internet traffic by 2020.


## Script
I started the project by spending some time with a technical writer to draft a script.  
<br>
Instead of simply saying what's happening on-screen, we wanted to draw attention to the connection between actions of the user and reactions of the system with the voice over.

## Animations and Effects
Used Camtasia's editing features to guide and focus learners' attention.

## Chapters
Chapter points were provided to make it easy for viewers to jump to the section they want without having to search for it. This was also a good way to see the most seeked part of the video.

## Video Analytics
Simply having video content available isn't enough.  
<br>
You need to know if people are actually watching your videos. Leveraging xAPI, I was able to capture user interactions.

* Played
* Paused 
* Completed
* Seeked
* Skipped 
* Abandoned  

You can interact with the demo below to see what your statements would look like.   



## Drop-off Points

This metric tells us when the viewers stopped watching or abandoned the video.  
<br>
This provides a visual presentation of where the majority of our viewers are dropping off and see what is happening at that moment in the video.



## Conclusion

<div class="img-box">
    <img src="/img/datix-graph.png">
</div>

Our video had a great retention rate; as 87% of our viewers played to its completion. Considering 10 ~ 20-minute videos has an engagement loss of nearly 60%.  
<br>
By having access to these metrics, we were able to translate these data into actionable insights to make our next video even better than our last.
