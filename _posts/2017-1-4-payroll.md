		<h4>Engaging Employees through Payroll</h4>
		<p>Based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report from 2017, nearly 64 million Americans say their paychecks are confusing to read or understand.</p>
		<p>Year-end tax forms don't make it any easier, either. While half of employees say they have never had a problem with W-2 Form, 35% have noticed a mistake, and 15% admit they wouldn't even recognize an error.</p>
		<p>To help employees better understand the impact of taxes and deductions on their income - HR, Payroll Specialists and I worked together to teach our caregivers to be able to:</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Add or update direct deposit</li>
			<li>Claim allowances on W-4 Form</li>
			<li>View W-2 Form and YTD information</li>
		</ul>
		<!-- <p>Our goal was to make payroll the easiest thing to do on HR's list. To make payroll fast and easy - Revenue Cycle Management, HR, Educators and I worked together to provide support by helping Payroll team how to:</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Get started with payroll</li>
			<li>Run payroll</li>
			<li>Manage payroll taxes</li>
		</ul> -->
		<h4>Payroll Errors</h4>
		<p>
			Payroll errors are one of the most costly and time-consuming mistakes; plus the IRS has been warning against a major W-2 scam targeting payroll departments.
		</p>
		<p>
			As one of the ways to reduce errors, I measured the level of activity to learn if there was a correlation between the level of engagement and payroll errors.
		</p>
		<h4>Engagement Rate</h4>
		<p>Looking at raw numbers doesn't say much; to put the data into context, I set a metric that measures the level of engagement based on the number of active learners and the number of total views for each lesson.</p>
		<p>
			I used the following formula to calcuate the engagement rate:
		</p>
		<div class="snap">
			<strong>( Likes + Shares + Clicks ) / Total Views</strong>
		</div>
		<p>
			For example: The course had 80 likes, 12 dislikes, 5 shares, and clicks came to 50.
		</p>
		<div class="snap">
			<strong>80 - 12 + 5 + 50 = 123</strong>
		</div>
		<p>
			Then divide this number by total views, and times it by 100 (this figure needs to be in %, in order to compare a course engagement metric with other courses).
		</p>
			<div class="snap">
				<strong>(123 x 100) / 500 = 24.6%</strong>
			</div>
		<p>
			The engagement rate for this course is ~24.6% which is great, according to Gallup's research only 13% of all employees are engaged during training/learning sessions.
		</p>
		<!-- <p>
			As xAPI access and user-database grows, we will be able to set and use it to benchmark the performance of each of our courses and ensure continuity of learning across all organizations.
