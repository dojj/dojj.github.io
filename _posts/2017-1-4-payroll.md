		<h4>Engaging Employees through Payroll</h4>
		<p>
			In 2017, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 64 million Americans didn't know how to read their pay stubs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Year-end tax forms don't make it any easier, either. While half of employees say they never had a problem with W-2 Form, 35% have noticed a mistake, and 15% admit they wouldn't even recognize an error.
		</p>
		<p>
			To help employees understand the impact of taxes and deductions on their income - HR, Payroll Specialists and I worked together to teach our caregivers to be able to:
		</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Add or update direct deposit</li>
			<li>Claim allowances on W-4 Form</li>
			<li>View W-2 Form and YTD information</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Engagement and Payroll Errors</h4>
		<p>Despite the robust online systems, 82 million american workers are still affected by payroll errors.</p>
		<p>To help our payroll team, I took the opportunity to learn if the level of engagement and common errors were related and whether one causes the other.</p>
		<h4>Engagement Rate</h4>
		<p>Looking at raw numbers does not say much because observations are not actionable. To turn our collected data into actionable insights that we can interpret, I focused on the number of activities and views per topic.</p>
		<p>The following formula was used to calcuate the engagement rate:</p>
		<div class="snap">
			<strong>( Likes + Shares + Clicks ) / Total Views</strong>
		</div>
		<p>
			For example: The course had 80 likes, 12 dislikes, 5 shares, and clicks came to 50.
		</p>
		<div class="snap">
			<strong>80 - 12 + 5 + 50 = 123</strong>
		</div>
		<p>
			Then divide this number by total views, and times it by 100 (this figure needs to be in %, in order to compare a course engagement metric with other courses).
		</p>
			<div class="snap">
				<strong>(123 x 100) / 500 = 24.6%</strong>
			</div>
		<p>
			The engagement rate for this course is nearly 25% which is great, according to Gallup's research only 13% of all employees are engaged during training or learning sessions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of our low sample size and fragmentation within departments, I couldn't account for underlying variabilities of the data to make any conclusions. However, as xAPI access and user-database grows, we will then be able to use it to benchmark the performance and decrease the margin of error to assess the performance accurately.
