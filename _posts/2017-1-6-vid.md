Our goal was to create a video on how to capture and assess important details in Datix to make incident management the easiest thing to do on our caregiver's list.

But creating a video is just the start of a continuing process. You need to measure the performance of your videos to learn how you can improve the next one. 

xAPI and xapiyoutubewrapper allows you to capture user actions like when the video was played, paused, completed, abandoned or skipped, and convert these metrics into an actionable data.

## View Duration

I monitored the average view duration to find the amount of time the average learner spends watching the content.

This data gives us a rough benchmark to evaluate and compare it to similar contents.

## Percent Completion

The average percent completion is the % of a video that is watched by a learner.

For example, if a user watches 20 seconds of a 30-second video, the video view rate percentage is calculated as 66.66.
This metric provides a sense of how well your content aligns with the learnersâ€™ needs.

## Viewer Retention

The purpose of this metric is to monitor video performance in retaining learners and visualize drop-off points.
