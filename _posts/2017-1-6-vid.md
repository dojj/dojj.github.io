Our goal was to create a video on how to capture and assess important details in Datix to make incident management the easiest thing to do on our caregiver's list.

But creating a video is just the start of a continuing process. You need to measure the performance of your videos to learn how you can improve the next one. 

xAPI and xapiyoutubewrapper allows you to capture user actions like when the video was played, paused, completed, abandoned or skipped, and convert these metrics into an actionable data.
