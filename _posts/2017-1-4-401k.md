# Financial Wellness

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ~30% of eligible employees don't participate in their employer's retirement investment plan. 

We wanted to encourage eligible employees to participate in a 401(k) plan, and help employees be more proactive in planning for retirement or making other long-term financial decisions, HR and I developed a course on:

* An introduction to the 401(k) 
* Sign up for a Fidelity Netbenefits account
* Schedule a one-on-one meeting with a fiduciary advisor


# A Comprehensive Approach

Recognizing that everyone’s situation is different, I designed a course that asks employees a series of questions based on their needs. They can simply answer the “yes” or “no” questions as they go, and, when prompted, respond to questions to help us convert feedback into actionable insights.

## Learner Satisfaction
User feedback is important in any organization but it can be time-consuming and hard to formalize. For this reason surveys were a better option to measure and track learner satisfaction.

	Engaging Employees through Payroll

	In 2017, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 64 million Americans didn't know how to read their pay stubs.

	Year-end tax forms don't make it any easier, either. While half of employees say they never had a problem with W-2 Form, 35% have noticed a mistake, and 15% admit they wouldn't even recognize an error.

	To help employees understand the impact of taxes and deductions on their income - HR, Payroll Specialists and I worked together to teach our caregivers to be able to:


	* Add or update direct deposit</li>
	* Claim allowances on W-4 Form</li>
	* View W-2 Form and YTD information</li>
	
	Engagement and Payroll Errors

	Despite the robust online systems, 82 million american workers are still affected by payroll errors.
	
	To help our payroll team, I took the opportunity to learn if the level of engagement and common errors were related and whether one causes the other.

	Engagement Rate

	<p>The following formula was used to calcuate the engagement rate:</p>
	<div class="snap">
		<strong>( Likes + Shares + Clicks ) / Total Views</strong>
	</div>
	<p>
		For example: The course had 80 likes, 12 dislikes, 5 shares, and clicks came to 50.
	</p>
	<div class="snap">
		<strong>80 - 12 + 5 + 50 = 123</strong>
	</div>
	<p>
		Then divide this number by total views, and times it by 100 (this figure needs to be in %, in order to compare a course engagement metric with other courses).
	</p>
		<div class="snap">
			<strong>(123 x 100) / 500 = 24.6%</strong>
		</div>
	<p>
		The engagement rate for this course is nearly 25% which is great, according to Gallup's research only 13% of all employees are engaged during training or learning sessions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of our low sample size and fragmentation within departments, I couldn't account for underlying variabilities of the data to make any conclusions. However, as xAPI access and user-database grows, we will then be able to use it to benchmark the performance and decrease the margin of error to assess the performance accurately.
