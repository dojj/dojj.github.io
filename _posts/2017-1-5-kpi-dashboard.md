		<h4>Identify Key Metrics</h4>
		<p>
			Worked with HR Operations Analysts and Educators to create a tool that focuses user's actions on the data that matter. To best serve the learner, we focused on participants' ability to:
		</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Navigate the dashboard</li>
			<li>View Scorecard and Executive Summary</li>
			<li>Interpret available data to make operational decisions</li>
		</ul>
		<!-- 
		<h4>Navigation and Exploration</h4>
		<p>
			We wanted to provide an easy way to explore relevant content learners haven't connected with yet.
		</p>
		<p class="second-p">
			Using xAPI statements, we gathered the number of views on each topic. Views tell us that the topic addresses learners' key questions and problems, and a way to measure content relevance.
		</p>
		-->
		<h4>Likes, shares, and feedback</h4>
		<p>
			It's nice to know how many users are viewing our content, but it's nicer to know if it triggers interest. 
			<!-- To measure the sign of interest, we examed the number of likes, shares & feedback. -->
		</p>
		<h5>Likes</h5>
		<p>
			I created a 'like' button embedded with a Trigger to execute xAPI verbs on each slide as a simple and quick way for users to express that they found the content to be helpful.

}

		</pre>
		<h5>Shares</h5>
		<p>
			Monitored shares as they often reflect how learners perceive the course, and highly shared courses can indicate the content to be helpful and relevant.

		<h5>Feedback</h5>
		<p>
			Feedback is one of the ways I ask our learners what I can do to improve their experience. Learners can also report a problem or send suggestions and ideas to help us constantly improve content and features.
