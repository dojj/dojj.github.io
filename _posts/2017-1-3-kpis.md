		<h4>Identify Key Metrics</h4>
		<!-- <p>
			A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a measurable value used to track and analyze company's performance over time.
			we focused on their ability to:
		</p> -->
		<p>
			The goal was to provide core leaders with an opportunity to explore people metrics, reporting and exporting functionalities of the dashboard along with exposure to the Scorecard and Executive Summary in depth.
		</p>
		<p>
			I collaborated with the HR Operations team to create a course that direct management's actions on the data that matter by focusing on their ability to:
		</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Navigate the dashboard and view relevant data</li>
			<li>View Scorecard and Executive Summary</li>
			<li>Interpret available data to make operational decisions</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Making decisions simple</h4>
		<p>
			I wanted to provide an easy way to explore relevant content core leaders have not connected with by reducing the number of decisions they have to make.

		<h4>Time on Page</h4>
		<p>
			One of the key metrics to measure user behavior is to track the amount of time they spend on your content. If people spend more time on a particular slide, they are more likely to be engaged or find it relevant.
		</p>
		<p>Using xAPI, I was able to capture the time spent on a slide by comparing 'viewed' timestamps from each slide:</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
{  
   "verb":{  
      "id":"http://id.tincanapi.com/verb/viewed",
      "display":{  
         "en-US":"viewed"
      }
   },
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "timestamp":"2018-01-19T21:11:15.050356+00:00",
   "object":{  
      "definition":{  
         "name":{  
            "en-US":"Slide 1"
         }
      }
   }
}
			</code>
		</pre>

			<code>
{  
   "verb":{  
      "id":"http://id.tincanapi.com/verb/viewed",
      "display":{  
         "en-US":"viewed"
      }
   },
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "timestamp":"2018-01-19T21:12:34.050356+00:00",
   "object":{  
      "definition":{  
         "name":{  
            "en-US":"Slide 2"
         }
      }
   }
}

		<p>Using xAPI statements, we gathered the number of views on each topic. Views tell us that the topic addresses learners' key questions and problems, and a way to measure content relevance.</p>
		-->
		<!--
		<h4>Likes and feedback</h4>
		<p>
			It's nice to know how many users are viewing our content, but it's nicer to know if it triggers interest. 
			(To measure the sign of interest, we examed the number of likes, shares & feedback.)
		</p>
		<h5>Likes</h5>
		<p>
			I wanted to provide learners with a simple and quick way to interact with the content, and find out if they like the content we're sharing.
		</p>
		<div class="heart-shape"></div>
		<p>
			To learn which content users find it interesting, I tracked the number of likes by customizing a 'like' button embedded with a trigger to execute xAPI statements.
		</p>
		-->
		<!-- <h5>Shares</h5>
		<p>
			Monitored shares as they often reflect how learners perceive the course, and highly shared courses can indicate the content to be helpful and relevant.

		</div> 
		<h5>Feedback</h5>
		<p>
			Feedback is one of the ways I ask our learners what I can do to improve their experience. Learners can also report a problem or send suggestions and ideas to help us constantly improve content and features.
