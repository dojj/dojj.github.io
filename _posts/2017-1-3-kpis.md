# Focusing actions on the data that matter

HR Operations and I designed a course to help core leaders explore: 

* Functionalities of the dashboard 
* People metrics
* Scorecard and Executive Summary

More importantly, this was a chance to get a clear picture of our learners' level of engagement.


# Engagement Rate

Engagement Rate is a key performance indicator that captures how much learners are interacting with the content.

To calculate for this rate, I focused on metrics like views, shares, and clicks to find out what is working and how we can further optimize the learning experience.


## Likes

</div>

I wanted to provide learners with a simple and quick way to interact, and find out if they like what they are seeing.

The following statement is generated when a learner likes something.

```  
{
 "verb": {  
    "id": "https://w3id.org/xapi/acrossx/verbs/liked",  
    "display": {  
      "en-US": "liked"  
    }  
 },
 "version": "1.0.0",
   "timestamp": "2017-09-06T02:30:16.987082+00:00",
   "object": {
     "definition": {
       "name": {
         "en-US": "Summary Reports"
       },
       "description": {  
         "en-US": "Summarizes 10 predefined reports within the dashboard."  
       }
     },
     "id": "http://example.adlnet.gov/xapi/summary-reports",
     "objectType": "Activity"
   },
}
```

## Shares

This metric is a good measure of how learners perceive the content. Highly shared courses can indicate the content to be helpful and relevant.

Shares were tracked using the LMS' built-in share feature.

## Clicks

By monitoring the number of clicks, I'm able to sort our content based on popularity. Reviewing popular content is a great way to see what is working as well as what isn't. 

```
{
  "verb": {  
    "id": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/clicked",  
    "display": {  
      "en-US": "clicked"  
    }  
  },
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2017-09-06T02:44:52.215348+00:00",
  "object": {
    "definition": {
      "name": {
        "en-US": "Status of Hires"
      }
    },
    "id": "http://example.adlnet.gov/xapi/example/status-of-hires",
    "objectType": "Activity"
  },
```
By declaring 'Summary Report' as the parent of 'Status of Hires', I was able to provide some contextual information to a statement.
```
{
  "context":{  
    "contextActivities":{  
        "parent": [
          {  
            "id":"http://example.adlnet.gov/xapi/example/summary-report",
            "objectType": "Activity"
          }
        ]
    }
  }

```

## Making Sense of the Numbers

Looking at raw numbers doesn't say much because observations are not actionable.

Using the following formula, I was able to provide context to our data and set benchmarks:

> ( ( Likes + Shares + Clicks ) / Total Views ) * 100

A clear learning experience strategy can help you find the most appropriate metrics to measure the performance of your content, and design courses based on learner behaviors.
