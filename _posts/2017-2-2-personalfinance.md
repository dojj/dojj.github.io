# Financial Wellness
 
  To encourage employees to be more proactive in planning for retirement or making other long-term financial decisions, HR and I developed a course on: 

  * An introduction to the 401(k) and how to sign-up
  * Fidelity Netbenefits site overview
  * Schedule a one-on-one meeting with a fiduciary advisor


# Personalized Learning Experience

  Recognizing that everyone’s situation is different, I designed a course that asks employees a series of questions based on their needs.

  Simply answer the “yes” or “no” questions as they go, and, when prompted, respond to questions to help us convert feedback into actionable insights.
