This course is about the testing activities that occur in the various project phases of the PPMO and describes the different test levels and test types that can occur. Our goal was to help users:
	
	<!-- <div class="bullet-points">
		<p>Understand the test activities that occur at each project phase</p>
		<p>Recognize the V-Model and how testing is integrated throughout the project lifecycle</p>
		<p>Compare theÂ four test levels' objectives, targets and types of defects they identify</p>
		<p>Compare the four test types</p>
		<p>Understand the reasons for implementing maintenance testing</p>
	</div>
	<h4>
		hmm...

	<p>
		...used a modular approach and combined the topics best suited users' needs
	</p> -->
