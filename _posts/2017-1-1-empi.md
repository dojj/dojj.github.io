# Maintaining Data Integrity
The Master Patient Index (MPI) is the database of our patients and the foundation of documenting patient care.  
<br>
Accurate patient identification in the EMPI is a critical component of patient safety. To maintain a clean EMPI, every caregiver is responsible for selecting – or creating – the right record for their patient at every point of care from front desk to back office and everything in between.  
<br> 
This course provides education for health information management analysts on: 
* Main functions of the Data Integrity team.
* Best practices for maintaining a clean EMPI.
* When and how to contact Data Integrity.


# Decision-Making in Ambiguous Situations

We wanted learners to explore how what they have learned applies to real workplace situations. Quizzes were found at the end of each chapter to encourage learners to actively engage in figuring out the principles by abstracting from the examples. And they were provided enough information to figure out solutions and then to identify how to apply those soluions in other similar situations. 


# Correlation Between the Common Errors and The Quiz Scores
*Due to the sensitive nature of the data involved, I'm unable to share any qualitative data from this project.*   
<br>
From the collected data, I was able to determine the correlative strength of most incorrectly answered quiz questions with the common workplace errors.  
<br>
Because the quizzes were part of the requirement, the participation rate was 100%. A correlation analysis was conducted between the error rates and the mean quiz score. Graphical analysis revealed a linear relationship between the two variables, with no outliers.  
<br>
The outcome of this assessment imply that performance on quizzes may be strongly predictive of common errors. These data have provided insight to Quality Assurance, Data Integrity, educators, and learners as to the most effective direction of our educational efforts to improve learning experience and improve patient safety.
