            <h3>KPI Dashboard: Focus Actions on the Data That Matter</h3>

                        HR Operations and I designed a course to help managers explore the KPI Dashboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This course provides a comprehensive overview of the People Metrics, reporting and exporting functionality of the Dashboard along with exposure to the Scorecard and Executive Summary.

                        Helped users explore the functionality of the dashboard by showing how to:

                    <li>Access the Dashboard</li>
                    <li>Navigate through the tabs of each dashboard section</li>
                    <li>Drill down to view the specific data required</li>
                    <li>Understand data that is related to People Metrics</li>
                    <li>Interpret and use this data to make business decisions</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Learner engagement</h2>
                <p>
                    Using xAPI, I was able to capture the number of likes, shares, and views to discover how learners are interacting with the content and learn how I can further optimize the learning experience.

                    Video has become one of the most engaging form of content. They can make information more digestible and easier to understand than a text article. But for most organizations, simply having video content available isn’t enough. You need to know if people are actually watching your videos.
