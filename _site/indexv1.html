		<h4>Improve patient safety and create a culture of learning</h4>
		<p>
			Our organization has adopted Datix, a web-based risk management software to provide an integrated healthcare experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			To ensure Datix was well-accepted by caregivers - Quality and Patient Safety team, Risk Management and I worked together to create a video on how to:
		</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Capture and review data</li>
			<li>Navigate the Event Status Dashboard</li>
			<li>Monitor event progress</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Chapter Markers</h4>
		<p>
			A navigable chapter list help viewers navigate, make it easy for them to quickly jump to the section they want without having to aimlessly scroll through the video.
		</p>
		<div class="pictures">
			<img src="/img/chapter-marker.png" alt="work sample" />
		</div>
		<h4>Learner Retention</h4>
		<p>
			The amount of views is a helpful metric, but that doesn't say too much about the performance of our videos. 
		</p>
		<p>
			By capturing actions like when the video was played, paused, completed, abandoned or skipped makes it easy to turn these metrics into an actionable data.
		</p>
		<h5>Demo:</h5>

		<h4>Engaging Employees through Payroll</h4>
		<p>
			In 2017, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 64 million Americans didn't know how to read their pay stubs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Year-end tax forms don't make it any easier, either. While half of employees say they never had a problem with W-2 Form, 35% have noticed a mistake, and 15% admit they wouldn't even recognize an error.
		</p>
		<p>
			To help employees understand the impact of taxes and deductions on their income - HR, Payroll Specialists and I worked together to teach our caregivers to be able to:
		</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Add or update direct deposit</li>
			<li>Claim allowances on W-4 Form</li>
			<li>View W-2 Form and YTD information</li>
		</ul>
		<!-- <p>Our goal was to make payroll the easiest thing to do on HR's list. To make payroll fast and easy - Revenue Cycle Management, HR, Educators and I worked together to provide support by helping Payroll team how to:</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Get started with payroll</li>
			<li>Run payroll</li>
			<li>Manage payroll taxes</li>
		</ul> -->
		<h4>Engagement and Payroll Errors</h4>
		<p>Despite the robust online systems, 82 million american workers are still affected by payroll errors.</p>
		<p>To help our payroll team, I took the opportunity to learn if the level of engagement and common errors were related and whether one causes the other.</p>
		<h5>Engagement Rate</h5>
		<p>Looking at raw numbers does not say much because observations are not actionable. To turn our collected data into actionable insights that we can interpret, I focused on the number of activities and views per topic.</p>
		<div class="pictures">
			<img src="/img/payroll-home.png" />
		</div>
		<figcaption>Monitored topics</figcaption>
		<p>The following formula was used to calcuate the engagement rate:</p>
		<div class="snap">
			<strong>( Likes + Shares + Clicks ) / Total Views</strong>
		</div>
		<p>
			For example: The course had 80 likes, 12 dislikes, 5 shares, and clicks came to 50.
		</p>
		<div class="snap">
			<strong>80 - 12 + 5 + 50 = 123</strong>
		</div>
		<p>
			Then divide this number by total views, and times it by 100 (this figure needs to be in %, in order to compare a course engagement metric with other courses).
		</p>
			<div class="snap">
				<strong>(123 x 100) / 500 = 24.6%</strong>
			</div>
		<p>
			The engagement rate for this course is nearly 25% which is great, according to Gallup's research only 13% of all employees are engaged during training or learning sessions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of our low sample size and fragmentation within departments, I couldn't account for underlying variabilities of the data to make any conclusions. However, as xAPI access and user-database grows, we will then be able to use it to benchmark the performance and decrease the margin of error to assess the performance accurately.

		<h4>Identify Key Metrics</h4>
		<!-- <p>
			A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a measurable value used to track and analyze company's performance over time.
			we focused on their ability to:
		</p> -->
		<p>
			The goal was to provide core leaders with an opportunity to explore people metrics, reporting and exporting functionalities of the dashboard along with exposure to the Scorecard and Executive Summary in depth.
		</p>
		<p>
			I collaborated with the HR Operations team to create a course that direct management's actions on the data that matter by focusing on their ability to:
		</p>
		<ul class="objectives">
			<li>Navigate the dashboard and view relevant data</li>
			<li>View Scorecard and Executive Summary</li>
			<li>Interpret available data to make operational decisions</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Making decisions simple</h4>
		<p>
			I wanted to provide an easy way to explore relevant content core leaders have not connected with by reducing the number of decisions they have to make.
		</p>
		<div class="pictures">
			<img src="/img/kpi-home.png" alt="work sample" />
		</div>
		<h4>Time on Page</h4>
		<p>
			One of the key metrics to measure user behavior is to track the amount of time they spend on your content. If people spend more time on a particular slide, they are more likely to be engaged or find it relevant.
		</p>
		<p>Using xAPI, I was able to capture the time spent on a slide by comparing 'viewed' timestamps from each slide:</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
{  
   "verb":{  
      "id":"http://id.tincanapi.com/verb/viewed",
      "display":{  
         "en-US":"viewed"
      }
   },
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "timestamp":"2018-01-19T21:11:15.050356+00:00",
   "object":{  
      "definition":{  
         "name":{  
            "en-US":"Slide 1"
         }
      }
   }
}
			</code>
		</pre>
			<pre>
			<code>
{  
   "verb":{  
      "id":"http://id.tincanapi.com/verb/viewed",
      "display":{  
         "en-US":"viewed"
      }
   },
   "version":"1.0.0",
   "timestamp":"2018-01-19T21:12:34.050356+00:00",
   "object":{

         "name":{  
            "en-US":"Slide 2"
         }
      }
   }
}
			</code>
		</pre>
		<!-- 
		<p>Using xAPI statements, we gathered the number of views on each topic. Views tell us that the topic addresses learners' key questions and problems, and a way to measure content relevance.</p>
		-->
		<!--
		<h4>Likes and feedback</h4>
		<p>
			It's nice to know how many users are viewing our content, but it's nicer to know if it triggers interest. 
			(To measure the sign of interest, we examed the number of likes, shares & feedback.)
		</p>
		<h5>Likes</h5>
		<p>
			I wanted to provide learners with a simple and quick way to interact with the content, and find out if they like the content we're sharing.
		</p>
		<div class="heart-shape"></div>
		<p>
			To learn which content users find it interesting, I tracked the number of likes by customizing a 'like' button embedded with a trigger to execute xAPI statements.
		</p>
		-->
		<!-- <h5>Shares</h5>
		<p>
			Monitored shares as they often reflect how learners perceive the course, and highly shared courses can indicate the content to be helpful and relevant.
		</p>
		<div class="snap">
			<div class="pictures">
				<img src="/img/shares.png" alt="work sample">
			</div>
		</div> 
		<h5>Feedback</h5>
		<p>
			Feedback is one of the ways I ask our learners what I can do to improve their experience. Learners can also report a problem or send suggestions and ideas to help us constantly improve content and features.
